# UK Smart Office Helper  
A simple AI assistant built in Google Colab using OpenAI API.  

## How it works  
- Takes user input and responds like a polite UK office assistant.  
- Saves conversation logs in `logs.json`.  
- Uses GPT-4o-mini for responses.  

## How to run  
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.  
2. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your OpenAI key.  
3. Run all cells.  
4. Logs will be saved locally.
